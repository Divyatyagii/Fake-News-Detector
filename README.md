# Fake-News-Detector
This project aims to tackle the growing problem of misinformation by developing a machine learning-based Fake News Detection system. With the rise of social media and online platforms, the rapid spread of fake or misleading news has become a significant concern. This system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to distinguish between real and fake news articles based on their textual content.

The project involves collecting a labeled dataset of news articles, cleaning and preprocessing the text, extracting meaningful features such as term frequencies and sentiment scores, and training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines). The trained model can then classify unseen news data and determine the likelihood of it being fake.

Key Features:

1. Data preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization)

2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings

3. Multiple ML algorithms for model training and evaluation

4. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis

5. Web interface for real-time fake news prediction (optional Streamlit or Flask app)

The primary objective is to build a practical tool to help individuals, organizations, and platforms automatically detect and reduce the spread of false information online.
